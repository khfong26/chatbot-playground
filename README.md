# Mini Chatbot Models

This repo contains several small-scale experiments and implementations related to building language models and chatbots from scratch.

### ðŸ”§ Projects Included

- **Bigram Language Model**  
  A simple character-level model that learns token-to-token transitions using PyTorch.

- **Transformer-based Chatbot** *(WIP or finished)*  
  A small transformer model trained to generate responses character-by-character.

- **Tokenizer**  
  A custom tokenizer that maps characters or strings to unique IDs, similar to the `tokenizer.encode()` process used in LLMs.
